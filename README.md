# typescript-apiservice

Implementation of a generic API service manager in Typescript.

## Purpose

Application to manage interaction with a web service, from authentication, making requests and handling responses. Thanks to Typescript, type safety in ensured in the request and response objects.

Classes have been used to allow chaining of multiple function calls together. fetch() API has been used as I wanted to improve my understanding of it without using a library.
